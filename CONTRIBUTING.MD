# Contributions

These guidelines might sound a bit on the strict side, especially for such a trivial codebase. However, I think they're important for a couple reasons. First, they avoid code contributions that are rejected outright. I hate wasting my time just as much as I hate wasting other people's time. Second, these are just good, common sense recommendations regardless of whether you're contributing to an open source project or a closed source one at work. Practicing good git hygiene makes reviewing code changes MUCH easier. Your peers and coworkers will thank you for it.

1. Before anything else, let's talk! [Open an issue](https://github.com/refactorsaurusrex/whats-new/issues) and outline your thoughts and/or ideas.
1. Before opening a PR, please make sure you've [cleaned up your commits](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). 
1. Implement your feature with surgical precision: Do not mix whitespace, functional, and/or refactoring changes in the same commits. 
1. Do not include unnecessary refactoring unless it's within the scope of what has been previously discussed and agreed upon.
1. In your PR, include a clear, detailed statement about what your changes do and why. Describe what motivated the changes.
